The pipelines are a great and easy way to use models for inference,  (**inference refers to the process of using a trained machine learning model to make predictions or generate outputs based on new input data. It contrasts(***Contrasts means shows a difference or compares by highlighting differences.***) with the training phase, where the model learns from labeled data.**).

These pipelines are objects that abstract most of the complex code from the library, offering a simple API dedicated to several tasks, including Named Entity Recognition, Masked Language Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Feature Extraction and Question Answering.
