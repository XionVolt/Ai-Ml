# What is Ollama ?
Ollama is an open source tool that is designed to essentially simplify the process of running LLM locally meaning on your hardware. 
[Resource for learning about Ollama](https://youtu.be/GWB9ApTPTv4?si=t_BxY0x4EAc2cL6v)
- Ollama provides a straightforward way to download run and interact with various models or LLMs without us having to rely on cloud based services .

- **Model parameters** are variables that the model learns during the training process to make predictions or decisions. These parameters include weights and biases in neural networks, which are adjusted to minimize prediction errors and improve the model's performance.
  - Model parameters can be used to measure the complexity of model , and capacity of the model to learn from the data .

- [We can also modify or we can say customize our model](https://youtu.be/GWB9ApTPTv4?si=gZ2JxzTaqqTRKC4J&t=3240) because we can add certain pieces of metadata to the model to what we want it to be . 
- Temperature in context of Model : Temperature is what allows the model to be more creative , more direct ..., More detailed explanation is in separate targeted file . 
- Basically we can also set different parameters for our Ml Model in separate file , for customize the model according to our needs
ModelFile explained in detail in separatefile named `modefile-customizeModel.md`
