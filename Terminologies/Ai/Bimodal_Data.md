# Bimodal Data

Bimodal data refers to a dataset that has two distinct modes â€” two different values or ranges that occur most frequently in the data.

## Key Points
- **Mode**: The value that appears most often in a dataset.
- **Bimodal**: Indicates two peaks in the frequency distribution.
- These peaks often suggest the presence of two different groups or processes influencing the data.

## Example
Suppose you're analyzing the heights of a mixed group of children and adults. You might observe:
- One peak around **4.5 feet** (children).
- Another peak around **5.8 feet** (adults).

This makes the data bimodal because it reflects two distinct sub-populations.

## Visual Representation
In a histogram or density plot of bimodal data, you would see two humps or peaks.
