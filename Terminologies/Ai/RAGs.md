# What is RAG 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in AI is a framework that retrieves data from external sources to enhance the quality of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Gemini. This technique improves the accuracy and relevance of LLMs by integrating real, reliable information from external sources, reducing the likelihood of AI hallucinations. RAG enables LLMs to access up-to-date information without the need for retraining, making them more effective in specialized fields and scenarios that require current data.

## How RAG Works

1. **Retrieval**: RAG first retrieves the most relevant information from a knowledge base using vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of documents.
2. **Generation**: The retrieved information is then used as context for the LLM to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## Benefits of RAG

- **Improved Accuracy**: By integrating external data sources, RAG enhances the accuracy of LLM responses.
- **Relevance**: Provides contextually relevant information, reducing AI hallucinations.
- **Efficiency**: Allows LLMs to access current data without the need for retraining.
- **Specialization**: Effective in specialized fields requiring up-to-date information.

## Applications of RAG

RAG is particularly useful for applications like internal Q&A bots that need to provide accurate answers based on specific organizational data without the costs and time associated with retraining the model.

In summary, RAG enhances the capabilities of LLMs by integrating external data sources, improving their accuracy and relevance in various applications.
