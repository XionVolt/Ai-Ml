## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing rules for a computer to follow, ML algorithms use data to "learn" patterns and make predictions or decisions.

    ## Traditional Programming

    - **Input:** Data and Program
    - **Process:** In traditional programming, you write explicit instructions (code/program) that tell the computer exactly how to process the input data.
    - **Output:** The computer follows these instructions to produce the desired output.

    ### Example:
    If you want to calculate the sum of two numbers, you write a program like this:
    ```python
    sum = a + b
    ```
    The computer uses the input data (`a` and `b`) to produce the output (`sum`).

    ## Machine Learning

    - **Input:** Data and Output
    - **Process:** In ML, you feed the computer both the input data and the expected output (labeled data). The computer uses this information to automatically generate a program (model or algorithm) that maps inputs to outputs.
    - **Output:** The program (model) generated by the computer can then be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

    ### Example:
    If you want a machine to predict housing prices:
    1. **Input:** Historical data like the size of houses and their prices (features and labels).
    2. **Output:** The computer creates a model that learns the relationship between house size and price, enabling it to predict the price of a new house based on its size.

    | **Role of the Developer** | Defines rules explicitly                         | Provides data and allows the computer to learn  |

### Key Idea:
- **Learning from Data**: ML models learn patterns from historical data and use those patterns to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- The more opportunities you will give learning algorithm(model) to learn the better it perform . Basically here we talking about more data .


### Supervised learning : 
Supervised learning refers to type of ml in which algorithms learns X to Y  or we can also say Input to Output mappings.The key characteristics of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithms , **examples** to learn from , that includes the right answers , whereby right answers means here correct label Y for a given input X and by seeing correct pairs of input X and desired output label Y that learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives us reasonable accurate prediction or guess of the output , 
Example : [Regression Problem](https://youtu.be/sca5rQ9x1cA?si=x5hcOOdTOfFomfpT&t=64)
Example: [Classification Problem](https://youtu.be/hh6gE0LxfO8?si=SNeN3leskHea-ul9)  , these both videos by `Andrew Ng` also tells you why `regression`(a type of supervised learning task) is different from a `classification`(its also another type of supervised learning task) .

**These two are two major types of supervised learning**


### Regression vs. Classification 

So we know Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data (data with known answers(we can say outputs/output labels y) of input/inputs). There are two main types of supervised learning tasks: **regression** and **classification**. Let’s break down the difference between them.

#### Regression
- **Goal**: Predict a **continuous numerical value**.
- **Output**: A number (e.g., price, temperature, age).
- **Example**: Predicting the price of a house based on its size, location, and number of bedrooms.(this *size*, *location*, *number of bedrooms* are inputs)
  - Input: Features like square footage, number of rooms, etc.
  - Output: A continuous value, such as $350,000(house price).

### Real-Life Example:
Imagine you want to predict the temperature tomorrow based on weather data like humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover. The output will be a number (e.g., 25.6°C). This is a regression problem because the result is a continuous value.(This is regression because our algorithm has to predict output number(y label) from a infinitely many possible outputs)

## Classification
- **Goal**: Predict a **category or class label**.
- **Output**: A discrete label (e.g., yes/no, spam/not spam, dog/cat).
- **Example**: Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam.
  - Input: Features like the email’s text, sender, and subject line.
  - Output: A label, such as "spam" or "not spam."

### Real-Life Example:
Imagine you want to classify whether a fruit is an apple or an orange based on its color, size, and weight. The output will be a category (e.g., "apple" or "orange"). This is a classification problem because the result is a discrete label.

## Key Differences
| **Aspect**            | **Regression**                          | **Classification**                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Output Type**        | Continuous numerical value (e.g., 10.5) | Discrete label (e.g., "yes" or "no")    |
| **Goal**               | Predict "how much" or "how many"        | Predict "which category" or "class"     |
| **Examples**           | House price prediction, temperature     | Spam detection, image recognition       |
| **Algorithms**         | Linear Regression, Decision Tree Reg.   | Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier |

## Summary
- Use **regression** when you want to predict a number (e.g., price, temperature).
- Use **classification** when you want to predict a category (e.g., spam/not spam, apple/orange).
