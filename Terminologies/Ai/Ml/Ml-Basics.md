## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing rules for a computer to follow, ML algorithms use data to "learn" patterns and make predictions or decisions.

    ## Traditional Programming

    - **Input:** Data and Program
    - **Process:** In traditional programming, you write explicit instructions (code/program) that tell the computer exactly how to process the input data.
    - **Output:** The computer follows these instructions to produce the desired output.

    ### Example:
    If you want to calculate the sum of two numbers, you write a program like this:
    ```python
    sum = a + b
    ```
    The computer uses the input data (`a` and `b`) to produce the output (`sum`).

    ## Machine Learning

    - **Input:** Data and Output
    - **Process:** In ML, you feed the computer both the input data and the expected output (labeled data). The computer uses this information to automatically generate a program (model or algorithm) that maps inputs to outputs.
    - **Output:** The program (model) generated by the computer can then be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

    ### Example:
    If you want a machine to predict housing prices:
    1. **Input:** Historical data like the size of houses and their prices (features and labels).
    2. **Output:** The computer creates a model that learns the relationship between house size and price, enabling it to predict the price of a new house based on its size.

### Key Idea:
- **Learning from Data**: ML models learn patterns from historical data and use those patterns to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- The more opportunities you will give learning algorithm(model) to learn the better it perform . Basically here we talking about more data .


### Supervised learning : 
Supervised learning refers to type of ml in which algorithms learns X to Y  or we can also say Input to Output mappings.The key characteristics of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithms , **examples** to learn from , that includes the right answers , whereby right answers means here correct label Y for a given input X and by seeing correct pairs of input X and desired output label Y that learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives us reasonable accurate prediction or guess of the output for the new given input., 
Example : [Regression Problem](https://youtu.be/sca5rQ9x1cA?si=x5hcOOdTOfFomfpT&t=64)
Example: [Classification Problem](https://youtu.be/hh6gE0LxfO8?si=SNeN3leskHea-ul9)  , these both videos by `Andrew Ng` also tells you why `regression`(a type of supervised learning task) is different from a `classification`(its also another type of supervised learning task) .

**These two are major types of supervised learning , used in different scenarios**


### Regression vs. Classification 

So we know Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data (data with known answers(we can say outputs/output labels y) of corresponding input/inputs). There are two main types of supervised learning tasks: **regression** and **classification**. Let’s break down the difference between them.

#### Regression
- **Goal**: Predict a **continuous numerical value**.
- **Output**: A number (e.g., price, temperature, age).
- **Example**: Predicting the price of a house based on its size, location, and number of bedrooms.(this *size*, *location*, *number of bedrooms* are inputs or features)
  - Input: Features like square footage, number of rooms, etc.
  - Output: A continuous value, such as $350,000(house price).

### Real-Life Example:
Imagine you want to predict the temperature tomorrow based on weather data like humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover. The output will be a number (e.g., 25.6°C). This is a regression problem because the result is a continuous value.(This is regression because our algorithm has to predict output number(y label) from a infinitely many possible outputs)

---

## Classification
- **Goal**: Predict a **category or class label**.
- **Output**: A discrete label (e.g., yes/no, spam/not spam, dog/cat).
- **Example**: Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam.
  - Input: Features like the email’s text, sender, and subject line.
  - Output: A label, such as "spam" or "not spam."

### Real-Life Example:
Imagine you want to classify whether a fruit is an apple or an orange based on its color, size, and weight. The output will be a category (e.g., "apple" or "orange"). This is a classification problem because the result is a discrete label.(This is classification problem because our algorithm has to predict output label(y label) from a finite number of possible outputs available )

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Output Type**        | Continuous numerical value (e.g., 10.5) | Discrete label (e.g., "yes" or "no")    |
| **Goal**               | Predict "how much" or "how many"        | Predict "which category" or "class"     |
| **Examples**           | House price prediction, temperature     | Spam detection, image recognition       |
| **Algorithms**         | Linear Regression, Decision Tree Reg and etc...   | Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and etc... |

#### Basically we can say in regression we certainly not know the amount of possible outputs available (it can even be infinite(more often infinite)) ,  but on the other hand in classification we know the number of possible outputs available(it can be many but finite).

## Summary
- Use **regression** when you want to predict a number (e.g., price, temperature).
- Use **classification** when you want to predict a category (e.g., spam/not spam, apple/orange).

## What are featues?
- Feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of the data. (basically features are what we calling x or input) 
- Also referred to as independent variables(as they are independent of everything unlike label(y) which are dependent on feature/features(we can now also say input or feature)), predictors, or input variables
   - Why we call them predictors : Because they are the input variables used by a machine learning model to predict an outcome(output can also be referred to as  y , target variable , or label) . They Influence the Target Variable (y) in some way. 
   - Example: In predicting house prices, the size of the house and location influence the price, making them predictors.

- Features contain patterns and relationships that help in determining the output

- The quality of predictors (features) directly impacts how well a model can predict unseen data . 
- If poor predictors are used, the model may not generalize well(means it may perform well on training data but may not perform well on unseen data).

### What Does 'Discrete' Mean?
The term discrete refers to values that are countable, distinct, and separate. In other words, discrete values cannot be broken down into smaller fractions (unlike continuous values).

#### 1. Discrete in General Terms
- Discrete values are fixed, distinct numbers that do not take infinite values between them.
- Example: The number of students in a class (10, 20, 30—not 10.5 students).

#### 2. Discrete in Machine Learning
- In ML, "discrete" is commonly used in the context of labels, variables, and data types:

##### **A. Discrete Labels (Categories/Classes)**
When we say discrete labels, we refer to classification problems where the target variable (label) has a finite set of values (categories).
   - Example:
       Spam Detection: Labels → {Spam, Not Spam} (Two discrete categories)
      Sentiment Analysis: Labels → {Positive, Neutral, Negative}

##### B. Discrete Features (Variables)
Discrete features are numerical variables that take only specific whole values (not continuous).
Example:
Number of pets → {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
Shoe sizes (in whole numbers) → {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Discrete Data**   | Can only take **specific values**, not in fractions | Number of students, dice rolls (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)   |
| **Continuous Data** | Can take **any value within a range**          | Height (5.7ft, 6.2ft), Temperature (22.5°C, 30.1°C) |
