# Unsupervised learning
***Unsupervided learning*** refers to the type of ml where the model learns from **unlabeled data** 

In unsupervised learning, the goal is to **discover patterns**, **structures**, **relationships** , or just something intresting in the provided data without any predefined labels or output.(Means we not provided with any output label , so data is *unlabeled*(**data with unknown answers**) unlike supervised learning where data we provided is with known answers(labeled)) The key characteristics of unsupervised learning are:
- **Goal**: Discover patterns, structures, or relationships, within the data. Here goal is to understand the data's underlying structure without prior knowledge of the output.
- **Output**: The output can be in the form of clusters, feature representations, or other forms of data organization that reveal underlying patterns.
- **Examples**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and association rule mining.
