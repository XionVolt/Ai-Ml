# Unsupervised learning
***Unsupervided learning*** refers to the type of ml where the model learns from **unlabeled data** 

In unsupervised learning, the goal is to **discover patterns**, **structures**, **relationships** , or just something intresting in the provided data without any predefined labels or output.(Means we not provided with any output label , so data is *unlabeled*(**data with unknown answers**) unlike supervised learning where data we provided is with known answers(labeled)) The key characteristics of unsupervised learning are:
- **Goal**: Discover patterns, structures, or relationships, within the data. Here goal is to understand the data's underlying structure without prior knowledge of the output.
- **Output**: The output can be in the form of clusters, feature representations, or other forms of data organization that reveal underlying patterns.
- **Examples**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and association rule mining.
- We call this unsupervised learning because we are not trying to supervise the algorithm , to give some quote right answer(output label) for every input .
- Instead we ask the algorithm the figure out all by itself that what's intresting , or what patterns or structures in the given data . 

# Clustering in Unsupervised Learning

## ðŸ“Œ What is Clustering?
Clustering is a type of **unsupervised learning** where the goal is to group similar data points(into what we called **clusters**) together without predefined labels. It helps in discovering patterns, structures, and relationships in data.
## ðŸŽ¯ Goal of Clustering
The primary objective of clustering is to identify **natural groups** in a dataset. It is used when we do not have labeled data but want to explore the inherent structure of the data.
[Examples and use of clustering by `Andrew Ng`](https://youtu.be/gG_wI_uGfIE?si=Kpk-XiI9-twsz0aj&t=137) 
Basically in the first example `Mr. Andrew Ng` gives us example of goggle news ,in which clustering algorithm works and that groups related news together(into groups (**clusters**)) , and we can say that this is a type of clustering technique they are using for this . 
Summarize - Clustering algorithms take data without labels and tries to automatically group similar data points into clusters .
