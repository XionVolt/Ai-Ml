Its just an inverse of exponential function

Example how many times we have to multiply 5 by 5 to get 125
```math
log_5125 = 3
```
In general:

```math
log_b(x) = y \text{ means }b^y = x
```
Where:
- $b$ is the base (often 10 or e),
- $x$ is the number,
- $y$ is the exponent.


In Machine Learning, we usually use log base $e$, written as:

```math
log(x) = ln(x)
```
- $x$ is the number we want to take the log of
- $e$ = Euler's number â‰ˆ 2.718
