- Its important to see where it used in Ai/Ml

***Matrix transpose is widely used in AI and machine learning, 
for various operations and transformations. 
It is particularly useful for efficiently calculating distances,
between data points, which is vital for tasks like image recognition.Additionally, 
the transpose operation helps in adjusting and analyzing data in different formats,
allowing transformations between different orientations, such as from portrait to landscape.
In neural networks, matrix transpose is used to process weights and inputs of different sizes 
where the dimensions do not meet the requirements for matrix multiplication,
providing a way to "rotate" one of the matrices to comply with multiplication requirements.
This is especially important in backpropagation, where the transpose 
of a matrix is used instead of the inverse to compute gradients efficiently.***

## A matrix transpose is just swapping its rows and columns 

[Example](https://youtu.be/g4ecBFmvAYU?si=nsU6hSgtqeB1t87I&t=5)

- We start with ***covectors (also called a dual vector)*** : ***Covectors*** are basically a machine that will eat a vector and output a number. We can also call it measuring device `as it measures the vector`.These are special devices in that they are linear.
That means if you have two vectors $\vec{v_1}$ and $\vec{v_2}$, and they are measured by this machine to be $a_1$ and $a_2$, then this machine will measure $\vec{v_1} + \vec{v_2}$ to be $a_1 + a_2$.

And if you scale $\vec{v1}$ instead of adding $\vec{v1}$ by $\vec{v2}$, say by some $\lambda\cdot\vec{v1}$
then it will measure to be $\lambda\cdot a_1$

- Linear Nature of Co-vectors
1. The phrase "linear" means that co-vectors respect two important properties:
    - Additivity: If you have two vectors, a co-vector applied to their sum is the same as applying it to each vector individually and then adding the results.
    - Homogeneity: If you scale a vector (multiply it by a scalar), the co-vector will scale the result by the same amount.


[A good analogy](https://youtu.be/g4ecBFmvAYU?si=Dnm2-RGafJ89-Nqj&t=110)

- A matrix at its core is a summary of a linear map (already know this)
    - The terms "linear map" and "linear transformation" are used interchangeably in mathematics and linear algebra.
 Both refer to a mapping between two vector spaces that preserves the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication.
This means that for any vectors $\vec{v_1}$ and $\vec{v_2}$ in the domain vector space $V$ and scalars $a$ and $b$ from the underlying field, the following properties hold:

- Additivity: $T(\vec{v_1} + \vec{v_2}) = T(\vec{v_1}) + T(\vec{v_2})$
- Homogeneity: $T(a\vec{v_1}) = aT(\vec{v_1})$
(where $T$ is a linear transformation)

Example algebraically:
$\alpha$ and $\alpha^*$ (where $\alpha^*$ is the transpose of $\alpha$)


Example matrix:
```math
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\rightarrow 
A^T = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 \\
2 & 5 \\
3 & 6 \\
\end{bmatrix}
```

So the most big picture is that, ***transpose is just transforming some measurement device in other spaces to the same measurement device in the original space.***

[Visualize co-vectors](https://youtu.be/g4ecBFmvAYU?si=OBqrqCAonKqQQgb9&t=264)

- So just like linear map, in 2D its suffice to know what $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ are measured to be.

  - If the measurements are $a$ and $b$ respectively, so for our purpose lets say we have $\begin{bmatrix}a \\ b\end{bmatrix}$ covector

   -  Now if you take any vector $\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y\end{bmatrix}$ just be linearity it will be measured as $x \cdot \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$ + $y \cdot \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$

   - So it will me measured as $x \cdot a$ + $y \cdot b$. This is just of function of two varibales.

# How a Covector Measures a Vector

When we say that a covector measures a vector, we mean that it assigns a scalar value to the vector in a structured way. This is done using the dot product.

Let’s break this down step by step with an example.

## 1. Vectors vs. Covectors
A vector is something that has magnitude and direction in space.
A covector is a function that takes a vector and outputs a scalar (a single number).

Mathematically, a covector 
```math
(a, b)
```

acts on a vector
```math
(x, y)
```

using the dot product, to produce a scalar
```math
\text{covector} \cdot \text{vector} = ax + by
```
This gives a scalar, meaning the covector measures the vector.

So the function come is :
```math
f(a, b) \rightarrow ax + by \text{\space \space \space (where } (x, y) \text{ is a vector)}
```

## 2. Dot Product
Let's take a concrete example.

Suppose we have a vector
```math
\vec{v} = (3, 2)
```

And a covector
```math
w^T = (4,5)
```

The covector $w^T$ takes the vector $\vec{v}$ and produces a scalar
```math
w^T \cdot \vec{v} = 4 \cdot 3 + 5 \cdot 2 = 12 + 10 = 22
```
***A covector just assigns a number to the vector, saying:
"This vector belongs to level 22 in my measurement system $w^T$. "***

If we measure some other vector $\vec{u}$ with the same covectorm(means same measurement system(we can say scale also)) $w^T$, we get:
```math
w^T \cdot \vec{u} = 4 \cdot 1 + 5 \cdot 3 = 4 + 15 = 19
```
***"The measurement tells us that $\vec{v}$ belongs to level 22, and $\vec{u}$ belongs to level 19 in the measurement system defined by $w^T$. This means $\vec{v}$ has larger measurement(larger length) than $\vec{u}$. However, the fact that both dot products are positive does not necessarily mean that $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ point in the exact same direction—it only means they lie in the same general half-space(`A half-space is one side of a plane (in 2D) or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions`) defined by $w^T$."***
