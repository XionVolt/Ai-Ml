[Most of the vectors are going to get knocked off their span during the transformation , see this clip](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g?si=nfvM19IPh24fcWnl&t=87)

[But some vectors do remain on their own span , even after the transformation](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g?si=QoGpZc_69YWJPA-r&t=117)

[And if some vector remains on its own span (assume that vector is `v`), then also other vectors on the line (in which that `v` vector located) will also remain on their own span , and all those vectors stretch or squish by same factor as the `v` vector stretch or squish](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g?si=yrwO1egbu7O9w4pa&t=146)

[EignenVector and EigenValue : Basically EigenVector are all those special vectors that we talk about that remain on the own span , even after the transformation](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g?si=qkoUJJ6lMFRB3pUc&t=202)
