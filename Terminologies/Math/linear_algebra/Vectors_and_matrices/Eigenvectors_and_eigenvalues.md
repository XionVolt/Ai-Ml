[Most of the vectors are going to get knocked off their span during the transformation , see this clip](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g?si=nfvM19IPh24fcWnl&t=87)

[But some vectors do remain on their own span , even after the transformation](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g?si=QoGpZc_69YWJPA-r&t=117)

[And if some vector remains on its own same span (assume that vector is `v`), then also other vectors on that line (in which that `v` vector located) will also remain on their own span , and all those vectors stretch or squish by same factor as the `v` vector stretch or squish](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g?si=yrwO1egbu7O9w4pa&t=146)

[EignenVector and EigenValue : Basically EigenVectors are all those special vectors that we talk about above , that remain on the same span (that they were before) even after the some transformation, and EigenValues are the factors by which those vectors stretch or squish, so we can say each EigenVector has a corresponding EigenValue](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g?si=qkoUJJ6lMFRB3pUc&t=202)

[Geometrically why this is a useful thing to think about](https://youtu.be/PFDu9oVAE-g?si=uhIhj1ohZPoJU_Pj&t=245)
