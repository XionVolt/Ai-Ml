## What's the determinant?
The factor by which linear transformation changes any area (of the grid squares) is called the ***determinant*** of the transformation .  [For Example](https://youtu.be/Ip3X9LOh2dk?si=T_rc0yz8YPh40k81&t=169)

## What if determinant = 0 ?
It means that the linear transformation squishes the area by 0 , if its then the transformation associated with that matrix squishes everything into smaller dimension . 

## Invert orientation of space ?

## Determinant Important property
`det(M1M2) = det(M1) * det(M2)` , where M1 and M2 are matrices

This saying : **If you multiply two matrices together, the determinant of the resulting matrix is the same as the product of the determinants of the original two matrices.**

- In python we have ***numpy.linalg.det(Matrix)*** to find determinant of matrix.
