# üìå Centroid (Average Vector) of 2D Vectors

## üî¢ 1. Centroid of 2 Vectors = Midpoint

If you have two 2D vectors:
- **A** = (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ)
- **B** = (x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ)

Then their **centroid (average vector)** is:
```
((x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ)/2, (y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ)/2)
```

‚úÖ This is also the **midpoint** between them in 2D space.

### Example:
A = (2, 4), B = (6, 8)

Centroid = ((2 + 6)/2, (4 + 8)/2) = (4, 6)

## üî¢ 2. Centroid of 3 or More Vectors

If you have **n vectors**:
- A‚ÇÅ = (x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ)
- A‚ÇÇ = (x‚ÇÇ, y‚ÇÇ)
- A‚ÇÉ = (x‚ÇÉ, y‚ÇÉ)
- ...
- A‚Çô = (x‚Çô, y‚Çô)

Then their **centroid** is:
```
C = ( (x‚ÇÅ + x‚ÇÇ + ... + x‚Çô)/n , (y‚ÇÅ + y‚ÇÇ + ... + y‚Çô)/n )
```

### Example with 3 Vectors:
- A = (2, 3)
- B = (4, 7)
- C = (6, 1)

```
x_avg = (2 + 4 + 6)/3 = 4  
y_avg = (3 + 7 + 1)/3 ‚âà 3.67
```

‚úÖ Centroid = **(4, 3.67)**

## üß† Geometric & Practical Meaning

- The centroid is the **mean position** of all the points (vectors).
- It is the **balance point** (center of mass if points have equal weight).
- In geometry: geometric center.
- In machine learning: cluster center (e.g., in k-means).
- Works for **any number of dimensions**.
