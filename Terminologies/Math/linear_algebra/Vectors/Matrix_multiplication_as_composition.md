Oftentimes, you find yourself wanting to describe the effects of applying one linear transformation, then applying another. For example, maybe you 
want to describe what happens when you rotate the plane **90 degrees , counterclockwise**, then to apply a **shear**. The overall effect here, from 
start to finish, is another linear transformation, distinct from the rotation and the shear. This new linear transformation is commonly called the 
***“composition”*** of the two separate transformations we applied(***composition*** of *rotation* and *shear*).

[It is a short way to find transformation of given vector after applying(multiplying) the n amount of those mutliple linear transformations on that given vector in respective order](https://youtu.be/XkY2DOUCWMU?si=RZQzAEd_ygdwRnRo&t=184)
**Basically multiply composition matrix to input vector you will get transformed vector**
