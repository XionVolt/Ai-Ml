## Summary and Main things to remember , thing we not understand
### 1. How to visualize vector coordinates :
- So When you have a pair of numbers meant to describe a vector, like (3,-2)  think of each coordinate as a scalar, meaning think about how each one stretches or squishes vectors.

- In the x-y coordinate system, there are two special vectors. The one pointing to the right with length 1 commonly called "i hat" in the x-direction". The other one is pointing straight up with length 1 commonly called "j hat" or "the unit vector y-direction".
  - Now, think of the x-coordinate as a scalar that scales `i-hat` stretching it by a factor 3 and the y-coordinate as a scalar that scales `y-hat`  flipping it and stretching it by a factor of 2 . 
  - In this sense, the vector that these coordinates describe is the sum of two scaled vectors. New vector produce by these two vectors is (3,-2)
