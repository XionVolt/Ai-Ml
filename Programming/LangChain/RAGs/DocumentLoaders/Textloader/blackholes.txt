Whispers of the Black Hole

In the velvet folds of space so deep,
Where light itself forgets to leap,
A shadow spins with silent grace,
A hungry ghost, no time, no place.

Its heart is crushed, a heavy soul,
A gravity well, a star-born hole.
No scream escapes, no tale is told,
Just swirling myths in silence cold.

It dances near with deadly charm,
A tidal pull, a cosmic harm.
It bends the stars, it twists the skies,
It drinks the light from dying cries.

Around its throat, the fire rings—
A crown of stars in spiral wings.
But cross its edge, the fate is sealed,
Where spacetime bends, and truths are peeled.

A paradox of force and grace,
A phantom lord of time and space.
It hides the key to what’s unknown—
To gods, to ends, to minds full-grown.

So gaze afar with awe and fear,
The black hole sleeps—but draws us near.
A mystery etched in cosmic scroll:
The universe’s darkened soul.
