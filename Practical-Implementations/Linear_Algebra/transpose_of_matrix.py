# So transform of A (any matrix) is a matrix which is obtained by changing rows to columns and columns to rows , and that's what we doing here .
# Like : 3x4 matrix becomes 4x3 matrix after Transpose.
# Example :
"""  
| 1 2 3 |
| 4 5 6 | => | 1 4 |
             | 2 5 |
             | 3 6 |

axes :tuple or list of ints, optional
If specified, it must be a tuple or list or int which contains a permutation of [0, 1, â€¦, N-1] where N is the number of axes of a. Negative indices can also
be used to specify axes. The i-th axis of the returned array will correspond to the axis numbered axes[i] of the input. If not specified, 
defaults to [axis for axis in range(a.ndim)][::-1], which reverses the order of the axes.

Returns: ndarray 
a matrix with its axes permuted. A view is returned whenever possible.
